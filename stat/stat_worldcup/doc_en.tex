World Cup 2014 Predictions

There are four python files that are used by this notebook. They must be in
the path. These are:

\verb!match_stats!: Reads the match statistics from BigQuery. Because we are using
the pre-aggregated data, most of the code here is disabled, but it is kept
in order to show the data transformations that are done from the raw data
in order to build the stats.

\verb!features!: Turns raw statistics into features that get fed into the machine
learning model. These features combine statistics from the trailing N games
to predict the next game.

\verb!world_cup!: Helper methods for cleaning the data and building and running
the logistic regression model.

\verb!power!: Computes a "power" statistic over a number of teams who have played
against eachother, attempting to come up with a ranking.

Building features

This will return a pandas dataframe that contains the features that will be
used to build a model.

The features query will read from the game summary table that has prepared
per-game statistics that will be used to predict outcomes. The data has
been aggregated from touch-by-touch data from Opta. However, since that
data is not public, we use these prepared statistics instead of the raw
data.

In order to predict a game, we look at the previous N games of history for
each team, where N is defined here as \verb!history_size!.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
import world_cup
import features
import match_stats
import world_cup
import pandas as pd
history_size = 3

game_summaries = features.get_game_summaries()
data = features.get_features(history_size)
\end{minted}

The features include rollups from the last K games. Most of them are
averages that are computed per-minute of game time. Per-minute stats are
used in order to be able to normalize for games in the world cup that go
into overtime.  Feature columns:

The following columns are the features that will be used to build the
prediction model:

\verb!is_home!: Whether a team is playing at home or away. This turns out
to be a big deal in soccer.

\verb!avg_points!: Average number of points (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0
for a loss) earned in the last K games.

\verb!avg_goals!: Average number of goals scored in the last K games.

\verb!op_average_goals!: Average number of goals scored by the opponent in the last K games.

\verb!pass_70/80!: Number of completed passes per minute in the attacking
30\%-20\% of the field.

\verb!op_pass70/80!: Number of completed passes by the opponent in their
attacking 30\%-20\% of the field.

\verb!expected_goals!: Average number of expected goals in the last K
games, where expected goals is computed based on the number of shots taken
and their distance from the goal.

\verb!passes!: Number of passes completed per minute.

\verb!bad_passes!: Number of passes that didn't complete successfully per
minute.

\verb!pass_ratio!: Percentage of completed passes.

\verb!corners!: Number of corner kicks awareded per minute.

\verb!fouls!: Number of fouls committed per minute.

\verb!cards!: Number of cards recieved (red or yellow) per game.

\verb!shots!: Number of shots taken per minute.

\verb!op_*!: Statistics about the opponent in the historical games. This is
not the opponent shown in \verb!op_team_name!; instead, these stats show
how the primary team's opponents have fared against them. For example,
\verb!op_corners! is how many corners the teams opponents have been awarded
per minute.

\verb!*_op_ratio!: Ratio of a team's statistics to their opponents.

Non-feature columns:

The following columns are included as metadata about the match:

\verb!matchid!: Unique id for the match

\verb!teamid!: Unique id for the team whose historical statistics we're looking at.

\verb!op_teamid!: Unique id for the opposing team. None of these statistics
reflect this opponent.

\verb!team_name!: Name of the team whose historical statistics we're looking at.

\verb!op_team_name!: Name of the opposing team.

\verb!timestamp!: Time at which the game was played.

\verb!competitionid!: Unique id for the competition (separates MLS from FIFA World CUP from EPL).

Target columns:

The following columns are target variables that we will be attempting to
predict. These columns must be dropped before any prediction is done, but
are useful when building a model. The models that we will build below will
just try to predict outcome (points) but other models may choose to predict
goals, which is why they are also included here.

\verb!points!: The outcome of the game. 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0
for a loss. (Points are not goals!)

\verb!goals!: The number of goals the team referenced by \verb!teamid! scored.

\verb!op_goals!: The number of goals the team referenced by
\verb!op_teamid! scored.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}

Compute the crosstabs for goals scored vs outcomes. Scoring more than 5
goals means you're guaranteed to win, and scoring no goals means you lose
about 75\% of the time (sometimes you tie!).

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
import pandas as pd
print pd.crosstab(
    club_data['goals'], 
    club_data.replace(
        {'points': {
            0: 'lose', 1: 'tie', 3: 'win'}})['points'])
\end{minted}

\begin{verbatim}
points  lose  tie  win
goals                 
0        768  279    0
1        508  416  334
2        134  218  531
3         23   42  325

\end{verbatim}

Note: How come as goals go beyond 4, the wins do not increase
automatically? These are goals from penalty shots at the end of games,
hence both teams might score a lot, but one of them ends up losing. See [1]
for more details.

Training the model

We're going to train a logistic regression model based on the club data
only. This will use an external code file \verb!world_cup.py! to build the
model.

The output of this cell this will be a logistic regression model and a test
set that we can use to test how good we are at predicting outcomes. The
cell will also print out the Rsquared value for the regression. This is a
measaure of how good the fit was to the model (higher is better).

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
import world_cup
reload(world_cup)
import match_stats
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 5000)
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)
pd.set_option('display.width', 1000)

# Don't train on games that ended in a draw, since they have less signal.
train = club_data.loc[club_data['points'] <> 1] 
# train = club_data

(model, test) = world_cup.train_model(
     train, match_stats.get_non_feature_columns())
print "Rsquared: %0.03g" % model.prsquared
\end{minted}

\begin{verbatim}
Rsquared: 0.149
\end{verbatim}

Picking important features

The logistic regression model is built using regularization; this means
that it penalizes complex models. It has the side effect of helping us with
feature selection. Features that are not important will be dropped out of
the model completely.

We can divide the features into three buckets:

Positive features: These features mean that a team is more likely to win.

Negative features: These features mean that a team is less likely to win. 

Dropped features: These features aren't important, and if we included them
in the model, we'd probably be overfitting. 

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
def print_params(model, limit=None):    
    params = model.params.copy()
    params.sort(ascending=False)
    del params['intercept']
    
    if not limit:
        limit = len(params)

    print("Positive features")
    params.sort(ascending=False)
    print np.exp(params[[param > 0.001 for param in params]]).sub(1)[:limit]

    print("\nDropped features")
    print params[[param  == 0.0 for param in params]][:limit]

    print("\nNegative features")
    params.sort(ascending=True)
    print np.exp(params[[param < -0.001 for param in params]]).sub(1)[:limit]

print_params(model, 10)

Predicting wins in club data

This cell uses the test set (which was not used during the creation of the
model) to predict outcomes. We can a few of the predictions to see how well
we did. We'll show 5 each from two buckets: cases where we got it right,
and cases where we got it wrong. We can see if these make sense. When we
display these, the home team is always on the left.

For example, it might show that we predicted Manchester United playing at
home beating Sunderland. This is completely reasonable and we'd expect that
the outcome would be 3 points (a victory).

The columns of the output are:

\verb!team_name!: Home team

\verb!op_team_name!: Away team

\verb!predicted!: The percentage chance that we believe the home team will win.

\verb!points!: What actually happenned. 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0
points for a loss. 

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
reload(world_cup)
results = world_cup.predict_model(model, test, 
    match_stats.get_non_feature_columns())

predictions = world_cup.extract_predictions(
    results.copy(), results['predicted'])

print 'Correct predictions:'

\end{verbatim}


Validating our predictions

Next, we want to actually quantify how good our predictions are. We can
compute the lift ("How much better are we doing than random chance?"), AUC
(the area under the ROC curve) and plot the ROC curve. AUC is arguable the
most interesting number, it ranges between 0.5 (your model is no better
than dumb luck) and 1.0 (perfect prediction).

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
# Compute a baseline, which is the percentage of overall outcomes are actually wins.
# (remember in soccer we can have draws too).
baseline = (sum([yval == 3 for yval in club_data['points']]) 
            * 1.0 / len(club_data))
y = [yval == 3 for yval in test['points']]
world_cup.validate(3, y, results['predicted'], baseline, 
                   compute_auc=True)
plt.savefig('doc_en_01.png')
\end{minted}

\begin{verbatim}

Need.... more .... power!

One thing that is missing, if you're predicting the next game based on the
previous few games, is that some teams may have just played a really tough
schedule, while other teams have played against much weaker competition.

We can solve for schedule difficulty by running another regression; this
one computes a power ranking, similar to the FIFA/CocaCola power ranking
for international soccer teams (there are power rankings for other sports
like college (american) football that may be familiar.)

Once we compute the power ranking (which creates a stack ranking of all of
the teams), we can add that power ranking as a feature to our model, then
rebuild it and re-validate it. The regression essentailly automated the
process of looking at relationships like "Well, team A beat team B and team
B beat team C, so A is probably better than C".

The output here will show the power ranking for various teams. This can be
useful to spot check the ranking, since if we rank Wiggan at 1.0 and
Chelsea at 0.0, something is likely wrong.

Note that because there isn't a strict ordering to the data (if team A
beats team B and team B beats team C, sometimes team C will then beat team
A) we sometimes fail to assign ordering to all of the teams (especially
where the data is sparse). For teams that we can't rank, we put them in the
middle (0.5).

Additionally, because the rankings for international teams are noisy and
sparse, we chunk the rankings into quartiles. So teams that have been
ranked will show up as 0, .33, .66, or 1.0.

Once we add this to the model, the performance generally improves significantly.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}

  if p > 0.1: return 1.0

On to the world cup!

Now that we've got a model that we like, let's look at predicting the world
cup. We can build the same statistics (features) for the world cup games
that we did for the club games. In this case, however, we don't have the
targets; that is, we don't know who won (for some of the previous games, we
do know who won, but let's predict them all equally as if we didn't know).

\verb!features.get_wc_features()! will return build features from the world
cup games.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
import world_cup
import features
reload(match_stats)
reload(features)
reload(world_cup)
wc_data = world_cup.prepare_data(features.get_wc_features(history_size))
wc_labeled = world_cup.prepare_data(features.get_features(history_size))
wc_labeled = wc_labeled[wc_labeled['competitionid'] == 4]
wc_power_train = game_summaries[game_summaries['competitionid'] == 4].copy()
\end{minted}

Predicting the world cup

Once we have the model and the features, we can start predicting.

Home Team Advantage

There are a couple of differences between the world cup and club data. For
one, while home team advantage is important in club games, who is really at
home? Is it only Brazil? What about other south american teams? Some models
give the 'is home' status to only Brazil, others give partial status to
other teams from the same continent, since historical data shows that teams
from the same continent tend to outperform.

We use a slightly modified model that is, however, somewhat subjective. We
assing a value to \verb!is_home! between 0.0 to 1.0 depending on the fan
support (both numbers and enthusiasm) that a team enjoys. This is a result
of noticing, in the early rounds, that the teams that had the more
entusiastic supporters did better. For example, Chile's fans were deafining
in support of their team, but Spain's fans barely showed up (Chile upset
spain 2-0). There were a number of other cases like this; many involving
south american sides, but many involving other teams that had sent a lot of
supporters (Mexico, for example). Some teams, like the USA, had a lot of
fans, but they were more reserved... they got a lower score. This factor
was set based on first-hand reports from the group games.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
import pandas as pd
wc_home = pd.read_csv('wc_home.csv')

def add_home_override(df, home_map):
  for ii in xrange(len(df)):
    team = df.iloc[ii]['teamid']
    if team in home_map:
        df['is_home'].iloc[ii] = home_map[team]
    else:
        # If we don't know, assume not at home.
        df['is_home'].iloc[ii] = 0.0
        
home_override = {}
for ii in xrange(len(wc_home)):
    row = wc_home.iloc[ii]
    home_override[row['teamid']] = row['is_home']

# Add home team overrides.
add_home_override(wc_data, home_override)    
\end{minted}

World Cup Power Rankings

The lattice of teams playing eachother in the world cup is pretty
sparse. Many teams haven't played eachother for decades. Many European
teams rarely play South American ones, and even more rarely play Asian
ones. We can use the same technique as we did for the club games, but we
have to be prepared for failure.

We'll output the power rankings from the previous games. We should eyeball
them to make sure they make sense.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
# When training power data, since the games span multiple competitions, 
# just set is_home to 0.5
#
# Otherwise when we looked at games from the 2010 world cup, we'd think 
# Brazil was still at home instead of South Africa.

wc_power_train['is_home'] = 0.5
wc_power_data = power.add_power(wc_data, wc_power_train, power_cols)

wc_results = world_cup.predict_model(power_model, wc_power_data, 
    match_stats.get_non_feature_columns())
\end{minted}

Predicting games

Now's the moment we've been waiting for. Let's predict some world cup games. Let's start with predicting the ones that have already happenned.

We will output 4 columns:

\verb!team_name!: Team we're predicting

\verb!op_team_name!: Team that the team we're predicting is playing against

\verb!predicted!: Precentage chance (we believe) that the team will win.

\verb!points!: If the game has been played, what actually happenned. (if
the game hasn't been played, we'll show a \verb!NaN! here). 3 points is a
win, 1 point is a draw, 0 points is a loss. Note that for games in the
knockout phase that went into penalty kicks, we'll mark that as a draw.

But wait! These predictions are different from the ones you published!

There are three reasons why the prediction numbers might be different from
the numbers you may have seen as published predictions:

We've updated our code several times to fix bugs and improve accuracy. Our
original model, for example, didn't account for extra time causing inflated
statistics.

Model building is non-deterministic. Since we pick a random subset of the
data to use as our training set, the results will change from run to
run. Sometimes fairly significantly.

When we predicted the round of 16, we used the trailing 3 games to predict
(since each team had played 3 games in the current world cup). For the
quarterfinals, we used the trailing 4 games; for the semis, 5, and for the
finals, we used all 6 [in this notebook, we use different ones at times,
please check]. The code below will predict based on the last 6 games; for
many teams, we don't have 6 games of history, and even if we do, that
history will be from previous world cups. To see a more apples-to-apples
comparison, set the \verb!history_size!  variable to 3 and rerun the
notebook.
