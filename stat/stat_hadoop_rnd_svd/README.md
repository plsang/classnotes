Random Projection Based SVD on Map Reduce Architectures Utilizing Distributed QR
=========================================================================

Simply execute run.sh it will process w1.csv and generate results in
U_final.dat. In order to compare these results to real SVD on the same
dataset graphically run compare_plots.py.

Packages required
